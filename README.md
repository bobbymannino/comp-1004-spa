## Steps to Completion

- [x] Create an actual idea for the SPA (use checklist below) ([Evidence](/evidence/idea-and-functionality.pdf))
- [x] Plan what it will do and why it has the ability to do those things ([Evidence](/evidence/idea-and-functionality.pdf))
- [x] Design the SPA on paper and get a mockup of what it will look like ([Evidence](/evidence/wireframe.pdf))
- - [Design V1](/evidence/designs/v1.pdf)
- [x] What will each button do and lead to? (Reactivity) ([Evidence](/evidence/wireframe.pdf))
- [x] Put it into [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and make it look pretty ([Evidence](https://www.figma.com/file/sPKQip1mWrJ3XvDKuGpyz6/COMP1004-First-Coursework-SPA-Design?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=371mMZCrtjVHCYNS-1))
- [x] Start coding it up (Componentize it as much as you can for reusability)
- [x] Test it yourself and get others to test it too
- [x] Fix any bugs that come up and refactor
