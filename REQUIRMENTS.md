# Requirements

My project is a calender app. It needs to serve many functions such as showing a live time and date, needs to show events, export calender and more. I've made a list of all the things it must have below:

-   Show live time and date
-   Have a month view of events
-   Editable, Deletable and Addable events
-   Export/import calender (as json)
-   Alert user of upcoming events in the form of a banner
