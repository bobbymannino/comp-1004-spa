# Meeting 29/11/2023

In this meeting we discussed how caravan boards help the workflow of the task overall and how we can track different things we need to do. You will have 3 columns of backlog, in progress and done. this helps the flow of tasks and overall productivity. it helps track what has priority and get things done in order. whilst im not in a team setting when i do it will help the flow of tasks between multiple people.
