# Meeting 29/11/2023

In this meeting we discussed how caravan boards help the workflow of the task overall and how we can track different things we need to do. You will have 3 columns of backlog, in progress and done. this helps the flow of tasks and overall productivity. it helps track what has priority and get things done in order. whilst im not in a team setting when i do it will help the flow of tasks between multiple people.

An event always has a type and it is listed below:

```js
{
    "title": string, // "Event title"
    "allDay": true // has to be true otherwise will have a start time and end time
    "description": string, // "Event description"
    "urgent": boolean, // false
    "color": string, // "#fff000"
    "id": string // "xxxxx-yyyyy-zzzzz"
}
```

or

```js
{
    "title": string, // "Event title"
    "startTime":  {
        hour: number, // 12
        minute: number // 0
    },
    "endTime": {
        hour: number, // 15
        minute: number // 30
    },
    "description": string, // "Event description"
    "urgent": boolean, // false
    "color": string, // "#fff000"
    "id": string // "xxxxx-yyyyy-zzzzz"
}
```

The only difference is that an event has to have either `allDay: true` or `startTime` and `endTime` otherwise it will throw an error.

The type for the entire calender json fill will be as follows

```json
{
    "[year]": { // 2023
        "[month]": { // 12
            "[date]": [ // 1
                [Event], [Event], [Event] // Event is a type as described above
            ]
        },
        "[month]": { // 9
            "[date]": [ // 12
                [Event], [Event], [Event] // Event is a type as described above
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
