Today we will focus on exporting the calender and importing a calender, this will be the most difficult task yet but i'm confident i have a good understanding of how to accomplish it already. Using a json file as input will make it easily swapable with the preloaded calender and to export it just create a hidden anchor tag with a download flag and the href as the json file. Simple as but make take an hour or two.

Next we will look into deleting and editing events. Deleting an event will be easy so i can do that with confidence but editing will be more difficult, i will have to create a new event and delete the old one. This will be a bit more difficult but i'm sure i can do it.
