Today we will focus on exporting the calender and importing a calender, this will be the most difficult task yet but i'm confident i have a good understanding of how to accomplish it already. Using a json file as input will make it easily swapable with the preloaded calender and to export it just create a hidden anchor tag with a download flag and the href as the json file. Simple as but make take an hour or two.
