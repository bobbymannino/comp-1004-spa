# Meeting 11/02/2024

I have decided no longer to do the .ics file thing. I get no marks on it and i must use json so there is not point using my efforts on that. Instead i will focus on refinement and ease of use. I also have 2 more features i will implement at some point; Persistence and time scrolling. The user should be able to use local storage to keep a copy of there calendar on their computer. And they most certainly should be able to scroll to see next week or the prior week, month, etc.

The persistance will be fairly easy due to proxies in javascript. So on the page load i will check for the local storage item and if it exists i will load it, if not i will default to the template file i already use. Using the proxies mean every time the variable changes i can listen to it and update the local storage accordingly.

The sliding calendar will also be doable because of the way i set up the load calendar function. The way i set it up was using functions that take in a current year and month so i can easily just swap that out.

The other part is cleaning up the UI and making it simpler, easier to use and of course...prettier

Change of data type. I am now changing the data type of the events and calendar data. This is because i am finding it more difficult then it needs to be to interact with the calendar object. I will be changing the data of the calendar to the same event type but instead of it being nested in objects to do with the day, month and year it will just be an array of events. with a property for each.
