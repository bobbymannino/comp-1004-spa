# Meeting 29/01/2024

I have done my research into industry standard practices regarding events and calendars and have come across .ics files. My aim is to implement this into my project by the user being able to import .ics files and eventually export their calendar as an .ics file. The way this will be done is by creating a template .ics file, then for each event create a VEVENT and add it to the file, at the end save it and the user can download it.
