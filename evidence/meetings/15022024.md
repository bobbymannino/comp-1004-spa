# Meeting 15/02/2024

This sprint was based off the remaining tasks to do. There are 2; add days of the week to each date on the calendar and use local storage to save the events locally.

Having each date on the calendar display the day of the week was a simple task. I used the 'Date' object (which is already formatted) to get the day of the week and then displayed it on the calendar with a bit of style.

The local storage was a bit more complicated. It has to be simple, readable and understandable. Another big thing is having the code component-ised so that it can be reused and if your debugging something it is much easier to figure out where a problem could be and fix it. With the local storage it is there to make sure that the events are saved when the page was closed and when its opened again the events are still there.
