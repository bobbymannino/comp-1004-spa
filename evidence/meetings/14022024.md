I have put a link to my caravan board again as it is being constantly updated per meeting with things to do, being done or have been done.

This meeting I had with a teacher (i don't know the name of) and some other people. They discussed the project, the good and ideas to work on. Below are 4 things that i made note of to do;

-   Saving data on browser close
-   Having days of the week by each number (date)
-   Have a button to go back to current month if you are in the future/past
-   Have a dark mode interface

I will get started on there changes right away
