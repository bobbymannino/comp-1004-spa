# Meeting 10/12/2023

Today I create the type called 'allDay' being that if a single event is for all day it will not have a startTime or endTime but just an allDay: true key value pair instead. This is useful for events that aren't a specific time. The insperation of this is because today is my youngers brothers birthday and that is all day, hence the feature.
