# Meeting 10/12/2023

Today I create the type called 'allDay' being that if a single event is for all day it will not have a startTime or endTime but just an allDay: true key value pair instead. This is useful for events that aren't a specific time. The insperation of this is because today is my youngers brothers birthday and that is all day, hence the feature.

You can now show description of the events in the calender as well by clicking on the event

A banner will appear at the top of the page if there are any events for today
