# Day Next To Date

Very close to the end now, speaking to some testers a couple of them have said that on each day in the calendar it should have not only the date but the weekday as well. They're right really, it should do and it's not too difficult to add either. Since JS has a built in date formatter we can input the 'month-year-date' and it can return 'mon-sun' for us. Then just add it onto the date, make it transparent so its not as obvious and we're done.
