# Persistance

One of the last sprints to do. After speaking to people and gaining their feedback it has come to light that everyone wants it to be persistent. This should be fairly obvious but they stated how useful is a calendar if it can't remember what your doing. To implement this i will be using 2 things, proxies and local storage. Local storage is the browsers local store for information. It is a key value pair object (value has to be string). Although you can only store strings you can use JSON parse and stringify to store objects and other data types. The other thing we will use is proxies, these allow for event listeners on objects which is perfect as it keeps the amount of code we need to write to a minimum while doing exactly what we're after. The code has to be simple, readable and understandable. Another big thing is having the code componentised so that it can be reused and if your debugging something it is much easier to figure out where a problem could be and fix it. Using local storage makes sure that the events are saved when the page was closed and when its opened again the events are still there. Persistance is vital to having the calendar be useful practically.
